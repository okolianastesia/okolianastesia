# Hi there, I'm Anastesia Okoli 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where data meets curiosity, coffee meets deadlines, and dashboards slowly become beautiful.


👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a Data Analyst who enjoys transforming raw, messy data into clear, meaningful insights using Excel and Power BI. I focus on building practical projects and delivering analyses that are simple, clean, and easy to understand.

I believe data tells stories, my job is to make sure those stories actually make sense.



🛠️ Tools I Work With

Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Lookups)
Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Dashboards)
Data Visualization
SQL (basic)
Pandas(Python)
Problem Solving and Critical Thinking

  
 
📊 What You’ll Find Here

Data analysis projects
Dashboards and reports
Practical solutions to real world data problems.

Basically: projects that show what I can do.



✨ Fun Facts About Me

I enjoy reading and traveling
I love clean dashboards almost as much as I love clean data
I believe Google is a skill (and I use it wisely)
